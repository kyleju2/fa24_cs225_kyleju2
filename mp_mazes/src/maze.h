 * This enum is used to specify the direction of movement within the maze.
 * Each coordinate direction is associated with a fixed integer value. 
 * The value is arbitrarily chosen but will be used for grading so don't modify this.
 *
 * The directions are defined as follows:
 * - RIGHT: Move to the right (Equivalent: +1 to the x coordinate) (Has value 0)
 * - DOWN: Move downward (Equivalent: +1 to the y coordinate) (Has value 1)
 * - LEFT: Move to the left (Equivalent: -1 to the x coordinate) (Has value 2)
 * - UP: Move upward (Equivalent: -1 to the y coordinate) (Has value 3)

   * top row), which is defined as the length (measured as a number of steps)

   * starting point as the destination of the maze. `solveMaze()` returns
   * the winning path from the origin to the destination as a vector of
   * directions.
   *
   * If multiple paths of maximum length exist, use the one with the
   * destination cell that has the smallest x value.
